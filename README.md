# Excel for Data Analysts — 4-Week Roadmap
---

## **Week 1 — Data Foundations & Cleaning**
**Goal:** Build a strong base for handling and preparing raw data.

- Understanding data types (Text, Number, Date, Logical)
- Importing data (CSV, TXT, Excel files)
- Structuring datasets in tabular form
- Removing blanks and duplicates
- **Text functions:** TRIM, CLEAN, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, FIND, LEN, TEXTSPLIT
- **Error handling:** IFERROR, ISBLANK, IFNA
- Data Validation (drop-down lists)
- Flash Fill for quick transformations
- Introduction to **Power Query** for basic cleaning automation

---

## **Week 2 — Essential Formulas & Conditional Analysis**
**Goal:** Learn the core functions that drive data insights.

- **Math & Stats:** SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, STDEV, VAR
- **Logical:** IF, IFS, AND, OR
- **Conditional Calculations:** SUMIF, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS
- **Lookup & Reference:** XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH
- **Dynamic Array Functions:** FILTER, SORT, UNIQUE, SEQUENCE
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlight trends and outliers

---

## **Week 3 — Data Exploration & Aggregation**
**Goal:** Explore, summarise, and analyse datasets efficiently.

- **Pivot Tables**
  - Grouping data
  - Calculated fields
  - Using slicers for interactivity
- **Descriptive Statistics** (with formulas & Data Analysis ToolPak)
- Sorting and filtering for exploration
- Quick summaries using subtotals and table references
- Combining multiple tables using **Power Query** (Merge & Append)

---

## **Week 4 — Visualisation & Dashboard Building**
**Goal:** Present insights clearly through dynamic visuals.

- Chart types and use cases:
  - Column, Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter, Histogram, Combo
- Dynamic charts with Excel Tables or named ranges
- Slicers and Timelines for interactive reports
- Dashboard design principles:
  - Layout consistency
  - Minimal colour palette
  - Clear KPI presentation
- Building a final **Interactive Dashboard Project**

---

### ✅ **Final Output**
By the end of Week 4, you should be able to:
- Clean and transform datasets using Power Query  
- Apply formulas and functions for insightful analysis  
- Build pivot-driven summaries  
- Design an interactive Excel dashboard that tells a data story

**Note:**  
You can extend this roadmap by adding *Power Pivot* and *DAX* later if you want to move closer to Power BI workflows.
